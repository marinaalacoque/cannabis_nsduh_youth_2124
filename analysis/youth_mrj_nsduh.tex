\section{Patterns and Trends of Cannabis Use and Mental Health Among
U.S.
Adolescents(2021--2024)}\label{patterns-and-trends-of-cannabis-use-and-mental-health-among-u.s.-adolescents20212024}

\subsection{1. Background and Rationale}\label{background-and-rationale}

Prevention of cannabis use among adolescents has become an increasingly
important public health priority in the United States (Bhangu et al.,
2025). This concern has grown alongside major shifts in cannabis policy,
the expansion of new modes of consumption, and a parallel rise in mental
health problems among young people (Nguyen et al., 2023; Hammond, et
al., 2020). The legalization of recreational and medical cannabis in
several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as the decriminalization of
possession and use (Mattingly et al., 2024), has increased both access
to cannabis and its visibility in everyday life, contributing to broader
social acceptance and normalization of use (Farrelly et al., 2023;
Lapham et al., 2023; Smart \& Pacula, 2019). In 2022, data from the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) indicated that 61.9
million individuals reported cannabis use in the past year, while 42.3
million reported use in the past 30 days, reflecting a continued
long-term upward trend (Mattingly et al., 2024; SAMHSA, 2023).Within
this evolving context, cannabis has become the most commonly used
illicit substance in the United States and the third most frequently
used psychoactive substance among adolescents, after alcohol and
nicotine (Ross, \& Levy, 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023).

At the same time, perceptions of cannabis as a relatively low-risk
substance, often reinforced by discussions of potential therapeutic
benefits, stand in contrast to a growing body of evidence documenting
its adverse health effects (Florimbio et al., 2024; Whiteley et al.,
2021). Adolescents may be particularly vulnerable to these effects due
to ongoing brain development and the central role of the endocannabinoid
system in neural organization, behavioral regulation, and maturation
(Scheyer et al., 2023; Hurd et al., 2019). Early exposure to exogenous
cannabinoids may therefore confer long-term consequences, including
cognitive impairment, emotional dysregulation, and increased risk of
psychiatric comorbidity such as depression, anxiety disorders, and
psychosis, as well as self-harm behaviors (Bhangu et al., 2025;
Florimbio et al., 2024; Scheyer et al., 2023). Prior research indicates
that adolescents with any history of cannabis use experience higher
rates of lifetime and past-year major depressive disorder (MDD), MDD
with severe role impairment, and past-year suicide attempts (all p
\textless{} 0.001) (Gukasyan and Strain, 2020).

Beyond mental health outcomes, both acute and chronic cannabis use have
been linked to impairments in memory, learning, attention, executive
functioning, and motor coordination, as well as a greater likelihood of
initiating other illicit substances (Queiroz et al., 2025; Camchong et
al., 2017). According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration's report, approximately 10\% of individuals who use
cannabis develop cannabis use disorder, with this proportion increasing
to 16--17\% among those who initiate use before the age of 18 (SAMHSA,
2024). Emerging research also points to broader neurobiological effects,
including dysregulation of the hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal axis and
disruptions in sleep architecture, underscoring the complex and
potentially enduring consequences of cannabis exposure during
adolescence (Bhangu et al., 2025; Velzeboer et al., 2025; Cservenka et
al., 2018).

Despite these concerns, important questions remain regarding the causal
nature of the relationship between cannabis use and adverse health
outcomes, as well as the directionality of these associations. These
uncertainties are further heightened by the rapid emergence of
high-potency products and alternative modes of consumption, such as
vaping concentrates and ingesting edibles, which have become
increasingly popular among adolescents in recent years (Lee et al.,
2023; Schauer et al., 2020). Notably, vaping illicit cannabis products
has been implicated in cases of e-cigarette or vaping product
use--associated lung injury (EVALI), which resulted in 2,807
hospitalizations in the United States by 2019 (CDC, 2020).

In this context of changing policies, evolving patterns of use, and
ongoing scientific debate, up-to-date and nationally representative
evidence is essential to inform public policy, prevention efforts, and
youth-focused health education. Accordingly, this study examines recent
patterns and trends in cannabis use among U.S. adolescents aged 12--17
years from 2021 to 2024, with particular attention to sociodemographic
differences, modes of consumption, and potential associations with
mental health outcomes.

\subsection{3. Expected Contributions}\label{expected-contributions}

This study provides an updated and detailed portrait of adolescent
marijuana use in the United States, highlighting its intersection with
mental health and contributing to a more nuanced understanding of recent
patterns of adolescent use.

\subsection{4. Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{4.1. Data source and study
population}\label{data-source-and-study-population}

This multi-year cross-sectional study used data from the 2021--2024
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a nationally
representative survey administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The NSDUH collects information
on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health, substance use, and
treatment utilization among noninstitutionalized U.S. civilians aged 12
years or older using a multistage, stratified probability sampling
design across all states and Washington, DC. Beginning in late 2020, the
NSDUH implemented multimodal data collection procedures, including
in-person and web-based surveys, in response to disruptions caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic (SAMHSA, 2023).

The analytic sample was restricted to adolescents aged 12--17 years who
completed the survey between 2021 and 2024 and had complete information
on cannabis use, mental health indicators, and sociodemographic
variables. The NSDUH applies standardized imputation procedures to
address item-level missing data; therefore, the final analytic dataset
contained no missing values on study variables. Analysis of these
deidentified, publicly available data was considered exempt from
institutional review board review per institutional and federal
regulations.

\subsubsection{4.2. Measures}\label{measures}

\paragraph{Cannabis use and Mental health
outcomes}\label{cannabis-use-and-mental-health-outcomes}

Cannabis use was assessed via self-report. Past-year cannabis use was
defined as any reported use of marijuana during the 12 months preceding
the interview (yes/no), and current cannabis use was defined as use
within the past 30 days (yes/no). Binary indicators of cannabis use were
created to ensure consistency across analytic models and to validate
exposure classification using multiple time-based definitions. Beginning
in 2021, the NSDUH introduced questions on marijuana vaping within an
``emerging issues'' section of the questionnaire. The standardized
questions assessing multiple modes of marijuana use were implemented
consistently starting in 2022. Therefore, analyses of prevalence and
mode-specific patterns of marijuana use in the present study were
restricted to survey years 2022--2024 to ensure comparability across
years.

Mental health and substance use disorder outcomes were assessed using
NSDUH-provided recoded variables for adolescents based on DSM-5
criteria. Past-year major depressive episode (MDE) and substance use
disorder (SUD) were operationalized using the variables YMDERSUD5ANY and
YMDESUD5ANYO, introduced in the 2021 NSDUH First Findings Report and
incorporating DSM-5 SUD estimates, including prescription drug use. The
binary variable YMDERSUD5ANY identified adolescents with a past-year
MDE, a past-year SUD, or both (yes/no). To characterize comorbidity
patterns, the categorical variable YMDESUD5ANYO classified adolescents
into four mutually exclusive groups: (1) SUD only, (2) MDE only, (3)
both MDE and SUD, and (4) neither condition in the past year. Consistent
with NSDUH coding conventions, adolescents aged 18 years or older were
excluded from analyses using these variables. These recoded measures
replace earlier NSDUH variables (YMDEORSUD5 and YMDESUD5ONL) and were
selected to align with updated DSM-5 definitions and post-2020 NSDUH
methodology.

\paragraph{Sociodemographic
characteristics}\label{sociodemographic-characteristics}

Sociodemographic characteristics included age (12--13, 14--15, 16--17
years), sex (male, female), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic White,
non-Hispanic Black, American Indian/Alaska Native {[}AIAN{]}, Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander {[}NHPI{]}, non-Hispanic Asian,
non-Hispanic multiracial, Hispanic), total annual family income
(\textless\$10,000, \$10,000--\$19,999, \$20,000--\$29,999,
\$30,000--\$39,999, \$40,000--\$49,999, \$50,000--\$74,999, ≥\$75,000),
health insurance status (insured vs uninsured), county type (large
metropolitan, small metropolitan, nonmetropolitan), population density
(≥1 million, \textless1 million, non-Core-Based Statistical Area
{[}CBSA{]}), and household poverty status (living in poverty, up to 2×
federal poverty threshold, \textgreater2× threshold).

\subsubsection{4.3. Statistical analysis}\label{statistical-analysis}

Weighted prevalence of past-year cannabis use among U.S. adolescents was
estimated for each survey year from 2021 to 2024, overall and stratified
by sociodemographic characteristics, modes of use, and mental health
status. Temporal trends were assessed by changes in weighted prevalence
and 95\% confidence interval overlap (two-sided, α \textless{} 0.05),
and linear trends were evaluated using multivariable survey-weighted
logistic regression with year as a continuous variable. Associations
between cannabis use and mental health outcomes were examined using
survey-weighted chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression,
adjusting for covariates. Separate models evaluated (1) whether
past-year marijuana use was associated with MDE or SUD and (2) whether
MDE, SUD, or both predicted past-year marijuana use, with adolescents
with neither condition as the reference group. All analyses accounted
for the NSDUH complex survey design, including stratification and
clustering, and were conducted in R (version 4.4.3) using
survey-specific procedures; and statistical significance defined as
two-sided p \textless{} 0.05.

\subsection{5. Results}\label{results}

\subsubsection{5.1. Prevalence of past-year marijuana
use}\label{prevalence-of-past-year-marijuana-use}

Among the 45,618 adolescents included in our analysis, representing a
weighted population of 103,611,766 (SE, 1,409,989) individuals over the
study period, 5,358 adolescents (approximately 11.7\%) reported using
marijuana in the past 12 months, and 2,961 adolescents (approximately
6.5\%) reported use in the past 30 days. Weighted prevalence estimates
of past-year cannabis use among U.S. adolescents remained relatively
stable from 2021 to 2023, with prevalence of 10.8\% (95\% CI,
9.7--12.0\%) in 2021, 11.4\% (95\% CI, 10.7--12.1\%) in 2022, and 11.0\%
(95\% CI, 10.2--11.8\%) in 2023. In 2024, prevalence decreased to 10.1\%
(95\% CI, 9.2--11.0\%), as shown in Figure 1. In multivariable logistic
regression models adjusted for survey design, compared with 2022, the
adjusted odds of past-year cannabis use were slightly lower but not
statistically significant in 2021 (AOR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.82--1.09; p =
0.42) and 2023 (AOR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.86--1.07; p = 0.43), whereas 2024
showed a statistically significant decrease (AOR, 0.87; 95\% CI,
0.79--0.97; p = 0.01). Overall, these findings suggest a modest
reduction in adolescent cannabis use in 2024, with no clear trend in the
preceding years.

\subsubsection{5.2. Sociodemographic
characteristics}\label{sociodemographic-characteristics-1}

Table 1 shows the weighted prevalence of past-year cannabis use among US
adolescents across sociodemographic groups, by year. Overall, prevalence
was higher among females than males, ranging from 54.8\% (95\% CI,
49.9--59.8) in 2021 to 54.5\% (95\% CI, 50.6--58.5) in 2024 for females,
and 45.2\% (95\% CI, 40.2--50.1) to 45.5\% (95\% CI, 41.6--49.5) for
males. Use increased with age, with adolescents aged 16--17 years
reporting the highest prevalence across all years (66.8\% {[}95\% CI,
63.0--70.6{]} in 2021 and 65.3\% {[}95\% CI, 61.9--68.8{]} in 2024).
Racial/ethnic differences were observed, with White adolescents
reporting the highest prevalence, followed by Hispanic and Black
adolescents, whereas Asian, AIAN, Multiracial and NHPI adolescents had
lower prevalence estimates. Geographic patterns indicated higher use in
large metropolitan areas compared with smaller areas. Prevalence also
varied by family income and poverty status, with higher use among
adolescents from households with ≥\$75,000 annual income and those
living more than twice above the federal poverty threshold. Differences
across years within most subgroups were modest, with overlapping
confidence intervals, indicating no clear temporal trends.

In multivariable-adjusted analyses, older adolescents and females had
consistently higher odds of past-year cannabis use (p \textless{}
0.001). Elevated odds were also observed among youth from middle-income
households (\$40,000--\$49,999 and \$50,000--\$74,999), adolescents
residing in small metropolitan areas, and American Indian/Alaska Native
and multiracial adolescents. In contrast, adolescents living in
nonmetropolitan areas and Asian adolescents had significantly lower odds
of use (all p \textless{} 0.001). Hispanic adolescents had slightly
lower odds of current cannabis use but were 46\% more likely to report
marijuana use disorder compared with non-Hispanic White adolescents
(AOR, 1.46; 95\% CI, 1.12--1.89).

\subsubsection{5.3 Prevalence of different modes of marijuana use among
past-year
users}\label{prevalence-of-different-modes-of-marijuana-use-among-past-year-users}

Considering different modes of marijuana use, smoking remained the most
prevalent method among adolescents across the study period, with
prevalence estimates of 76.7\% (95\% CI, 72.4\%--80.9\%) in 2022, 79.6\%
(95\% CI, 75.9\%--83.2\%) in 2023, and 75.4\% (95\% CI, 71.3\%--79.4\%)
in 2024 (Figure 2). Vaping was the second most common mode of use and
demonstrated a significant increasing temporal trend (AOR per year,
1.72; 95\% CI, 1.34--2.20; p \textless{} .001), with prevalence rising
from 60.3\% (95\% CI, 56.0\%--64.6\%) in 2022 to 64.8\% (95\% CI,
60.2\%--69.3\%) in 2023, and reaching 72.3\% (95\% CI, 69.0\%--75.6\%)
in 2024.

In contrast, dabbing (waxes or concentrates) showed a decreasing trend
over time (AOR per year, 0.70; 95\% CI, 0.50--0.99; p = .044),
consistent with declining prevalence estimates across survey years. No
statistically significant temporal trends were observed for the
remaining modes of marijuana use, with less commonly reported methods
including oral products (drops or sprays), with prevalences below 3\% in
all years; topical products, which declined from 7.5\% (95\% CI,
5.1\%--10.0\%) in 2022 to 4.4\% (95\% CI, 2.5\%--6.3\%) in 2024; and
pills and other methods, each consistently reported by fewer than 5\% of
adolescents.

\section{5.4. Past-year marijuana use, and Major Depressive
Episode/Substance Use
Disorder}\label{past-year-marijuana-use-and-major-depressive-episodesubstance-use-disorder}

In this analysis of adolescents, older age, female sex, and past-year
marijuana use were significantly associated with higher odds of
experiencing a MDE or SUD. Adolescents aged 14--15 had an AOR of 1.60
(95\% CI, 1.46--1.76), and those aged 16--17 had an AOR of 1.79 (95\%
CI, 1.59--2.01), compared with 12--13-year-olds. Females demonstrated
nearly threefold higher odds than males (AOR, 2.86; 95\% CI,
2.61--3.13). Family income exhibited limited associations, with only
adolescents from households earning \$50--74k showing a modestly
elevated risk (AOR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.01--1.26). County type was not
significantly associated with the outcome. Regarding race and ethnicity,
Black (AOR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.63--0.80), Asian (AOR, 0.76; 95\% CI,
0.61--0.96), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander adolescents (AOR,
0.37; 95\% CI, 0.17--0.83) had lower odds compared with non-Hispanic
White adolescents, whereas Non-Hispanic multiracial adolescents had
higher odds (AOR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 1.07--1.51).

Past-year marijuana use was the strongest predictor of MDE/SUD, with
users showing markedly increased odds (AOR, 9.62; 95\% CI, 8.38--11.04);
specifically, adolescents who used marijuana in the past year had
substantially higher odds of experiencing SUD only (AOR, 22.15; 95\% CI,
18.69--26.25) or comorbid SUD and MDE (AOR, 21.79; 95\% CI,
17.00--27.94) compared with those with neither condition in adjusted
models.
